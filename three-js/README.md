I think with Dockerized APIs, the goal becomes:
Anyone can dump in vectors of numbers or raw data files, and then be directed to a Three JS environment in-browser that shows a 3D scene that they can explore on their screen or through a VR headset.

And when I say anyone, I mean anyone who uses anyone who can call an API.

Or then can get an FBX or a GLB.
So the first look should be in-browser through Three JS, in an embedded frame or an immersive single-frame page.
And then, if someone wants an export file, they can get a flat 2D vector based SVG or PDF.

Quote:
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are like the connectors or middlemen of the tech world. They enable different software systems to communicate with each other. Hereâ€™s a broad range of people who might typically use API calls:

- **Developers:** They use APIs to integrate different systems, access third-party services, and enable communication between different software components.
- **Data Analysts:** They use APIs to access data from various sources, such as databases or web services, for analysis and visualization.
- **IT Professionals:** They use APIs to manage and automate IT processes, such as deploying applications or monitoring systems.
- **Business Analysts:** They use APIs to gather data and insights from different tools and platforms to make informed business decisions.
- **Product Managers:** They use APIs to understand how their product can integrate with other services or to specify requirements for development teams.
- **End Users:** Sometimes, end users indirectly use APIs when they interact with apps and services that rely on API calls in the background.

So devs can easily make calls to Pavlov and then roll out those 3D environments (generated from their data) as a pane on a dashboard or a link on their webpage.
